## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogies

- **S3 = Dropbox or Google Drive** â†’ Upload and share any file, highly durable.  
- **EBS = USB drive** â†’ Plugged into one EC2 (server) at a time, fast and reliable.  
- **EFS = Company network drive** â†’ Multiple servers can read/write at once, shared storage.  
- **FSx = Specialized file server** â†’ Windows/Linux file systems for specific apps.  
- **Glacier = Old filing cabinet in the basement** â†’ Very cheap, but slow to retrieve.
